The following is subject to change and is made completely blind
## Training Data
Look at how to structure the training data, and how to get the training data and how it should be processed. Maybe 3d models with autogenerated screenshots of them using python or another language if required (I only know python.) (this may also not work because its not a real world photo, but noise etc can be added)
## Implement in pyTorch or Tensorflow
A simple test with a couple pieces only, images with one in each as a proof of concept. 
## Live Tracking
Start working with live video real time, drawing boxes around pieces and identifying and counting them. Also explore how to get it working locally on iPhone (maybe involving learning swift)
