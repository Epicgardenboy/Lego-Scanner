I want to preface everything in this document with I have not looked into the viability really yet of this project and it may not be feasible/possible for me to do myself with the limitations

## Main Goal
Similar to brickognize https://brickognize.com but for multiple parts, and more geared towards helping inventory lego sets and check what pieces are missing without having to go through and check each piece (you will know the pain if you have done it)

An app for iPhone if possible with all processing happening on device, I am not sure how possible this is and with what phones it would work (ram is the limitation I am thinking of, the NPU should be fine if I can use it. But first get it working in python and then try to move it over if possible (very early on and not very knowledgeable)

Pieces should be labelled with their Bricklink names and Lego names so they can be identified easily

## Possible Future Idea
Be able to inventory a large selection of lego e.g. joblots from eBay or car boot sales and be able to see what sets may be present.

Use LIDAR on newest pro iPhones and iPads to assess quality of pieces, e.g. chewed or malformed/damaged (This depends on how detailed the lidar scans are, more research needed. Photogrammetry is also an option but probably too hard to implement, too much processing for phones and overkill)
